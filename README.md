# üé® Color Detection Tool using OpenCV and Pandas

A simple Python project built during high school that allows users to detect the color name of any pixel in an image using OpenCV and a custom color dataset.

## üß† Overview
This project was my first experience working with images, pixel values, and color recognition.

When you double-click anywhere on the image window, the program reads the pixel‚Äôs RGB values and matches it to the closest color name in a CSV file.

## üîß Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- `opencv-python`  
- `pandas`  
- A `colors.csv` file containing color names and RGB values (already included in this repo)

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pandas
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

Open your terminal (or Command Prompt), navigate to the project folder, and run:

```bash
python color_detection.py -i <image_path> -a <image_format>
```

**Arguments:**

- `-i` ‚Üí Path to the image file (e.g., `a.jpg`, `b.png`)
- `-a` ‚Üí Image format (e.g., `jpg`, `png`)

---

## üñ±Ô∏è How to Use

- **Double Left Click** on any part of the image: detects and displays the RGB value and closest color name.
- **Right Click**: optional, may be used to exit or reset.
- **Enter Key**: optional, may trigger save or exit (if implemented).

## üìÅ Example
